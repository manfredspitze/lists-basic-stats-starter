## Python: Simple Statistics with Lists

### Getting Started

- Create a GitHub repo named: **simple-list-stats**
    - Upload your project files to the repo
    - No need to share your repo with your teacher
    - Teacher will discuss your work with you during Teacher  Time

- Create a NEW folder on your workstation desktop
- Use VS Code to add your Python file to this new folder


### Objective

> *In this practice project, you'll learn how to:*
>
> - *use the `max()` function to find the largest numeric value in a list*
>
> - *use the `min()` function to find the smallest numeric value in a list*
> 
> - *use the `sum()` function to find the sum of the numeric values in a list*

### Quiz Scores
- Store six (6) of your most recent Chemistry quiz scores in a list called *scores*
- Use f-strings, the `len()` function and the `sum()` function to calculate and display your average quiz score

### Driving Distances

- Store five (5) driving distances in a list called *distances*
- Use Google Maps to look up the round trip driving distances (in miles) between Traverse City and five other cities within or outside of Michigan
- Add these driving distances to your *distances* list
- Print a statement that says what the shortest round trip driving distance is between Traverse City and [destination name]
- Print a statement that says what the longest round trip driving distance is between Traverse City and [destination name]
- Print a statement that says what the AVERAGE round trip driving distance is between Traverse City and the five destinations you selected
